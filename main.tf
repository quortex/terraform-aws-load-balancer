# There are 3 types of load balancers in AWS: 
# - Classic
# - NLB (Network Load Balancer)
# - ALB (Application Load Balancer)
#
# Here an Application Load Balancer is created.
# It listens for HTTP and HTTPS, and forwards HTTPS to instances of the 
# target group.
# The target group is made of instances, which are the instances of the
# autoscaling group.
